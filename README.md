###Question 1
sortByStrings(s,t): Sort the letters in the string s by the order they occur in the string t. You can assume t will not have repetitive characters. For s = "weather" and t = "therapyw", the output should be sortByString(s, t) = "theeraw". For s = "good" and t = "odg", the output should be sortByString(s, t) = "oodg".

###Question 2 
decodeString(s): Given an encoded string, return its corresponding decoded string. 

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is repeated exactly k times. Note: k is guaranteed to be a positive integer. 

For s = "4[ab]", the output should be decodeString(s) = "abababab" 
For s = "2[b3[a]]", the output should be decodeString(s) = "baaabaaa"
